					<p>As exciting as it is to buy a new car — err, at least one new to you — the process of finding and purchasing any vehicle is exhausting. You wouldn’t be surprised to find a sleazy salesman breathing down your neck as you peruse the lot’s selection, trying to put you in a different car at every turn. Given the aforementioned situation, or a similar scenario thereof, it’s no wonder nobody enjoys perusing Bob’s Used Car Emporium for a new set of cars under such stressful conditions.</p> 
 <p> Thankfully, the Internet boasts a bevy of virtual car lots, lined with everything from mid-size sedans to all-terrain pickup trucks. The sites allow you to swap the salesman and pressure-laden environment for a comfortable desk chair, while providing you with all the necessary information regarding each car’s condition and supposed history. However, the question remains, which site is the most competent and coupled with a dearth of scammers, crooks, and the like?</p>
 <p>Here is our top selection of the best used car websites for bettering your online shopping experience. No cheesy slick-backs, no false information, and no forced decisions; just the best websites to help you buy a used ride. Also, skim our list detailing the essential questions you should ask when buying a used car and our roundup of the best cars for new drivers if you’re still shopping around.</p>
